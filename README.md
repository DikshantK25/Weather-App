# Weather App

A simple weather application that allows users to search for a city and view its current weather conditions. This project uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data and displays the results with dynamic weather icons.

## Features

- **City Search:** Enter any city name to get current weather information.
- **Real-time Data:** Displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed in real time.
- **Dynamic Weather Icons:** Automatically updates the weather icon based on current conditions (e.g., clear, clouds, rain, drizzle, mist).
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For the structure and styling of the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For API integration and DOM manipulation.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Provides up-to-date weather information.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred browser** to run the app locally.

## Setup

- **API Key:**  
  Replace the `apiKey` variable in your JavaScript file with your own API key from OpenWeatherMap:
  
  ```js
  const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
  ```

- **Images:**  
  Ensure the images used for different weather conditions (e.g., `clouds.png`, `clear.png`, `rain.png`, etc.) are located in the `images` folder.

## Usage

1. Type the name of the city into the search input.
2. Click the search button.
3. The application will fetch the current weather data and update the UI with:
   - City name
   - Temperature (in °C)
   - Humidity percentage
   - Wind speed (in km/h)
   - A weather icon representing the current weather condition
